# Project 2

With Project 1 out of the way, it's time to work as a group to build your first full-stack application that leverages advanced tools and frameworks! 
No holding back on this one, every bit of abstraction we've covered is at your disposal!

## High-Level Requirements

Application must leverage the full stack: 
- RDBMS for persistence 
- API built with Java 8 and Spring 5
- UI built with React

Technology framework requirements: 
- Java API will use Hibernate to communicate with a PostGreSQL RDBMS 
- Java API will leverage the Spring Framework 
- Java API will be RESTful (no `HttpSession`, use JWTs!)
 

Other requirements: 
- Application will demonstrate at least 10 individual user stories 
- Application's own data model must be sufficiently complex (i.e. >2 tables) 
- RDBMS will be deployed to the cloud (AWS RDS) 
- Java API will be deployed to the cloud (AWS EC2) 
- UI application will be deployed to the cloud (AWS S3) 
- Java API will have >=80% test coverage for service layer

Suggested bonus goals:
- Secure your Java API using Spring Security
- Java API will be adequately documented (Java Docs and web endpoint documentation [Swagger/OpenAPI])
 
## Other Thoughts
The project concepts must be approved by the trainer. In addition to your project proposal, teams should also structure themselves with one team leader and a person or persons who fulfill the role of Gitflow manager and DevOps engineer.  
Lastly, avoid the temptation to divide work into "API" and "UI", all associates should implement logic on both sides of the stack! 

## Presentations

Presentations will occur on the morning of Friday, July 22nd. All team members must have a speaking role in the presentation of the application, and a PowerPoint slideshow is encouraged to accompany your presentation.
