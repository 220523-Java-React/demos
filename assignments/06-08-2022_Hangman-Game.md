# Hangman Game

## Description
Hangman is a word guessing game in which you make attempts to guess a word by guessing each letter
individually. If a letter is correct, it is displayed on the screen in its location within the word.
If a letter is incorrect, you lose a life. When you run out of lives, you lose the game. If you
guess all the letters before you run out of lives, you win!

## Instructions
Complete the implementation in the week3/Hangman/src/main/java/com/revature/Driver.java such that the
game is playable, winnable and losable. When your implementation is complete, push your code
to the demos repository under your team's branch.
